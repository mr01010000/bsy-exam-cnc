# CVUT FEL - BSY Exam, Stage 5
A very rudimentary implementation of a C&C controller and a bot. The controller allows the user to send commands to a GitHub gist, 
which are read and by all of the bots connected to the same gist.



The communication is hidden inside gist comments, which all contain a random picture of a cat and a quote. Cats are responsibly sourced from 
[https://placekitten.com/](https://placekitten.com/), quotes are generated by [http://quotable.io/](http://quotable.io/).

You can see the communication example in the provided test gist: https://gist.github.com/mr01010000/413add15a2e073ee71989820426a6c3a

Practically speaking, the implementation is unsafe, as it does not sanitize user input and can execute arbitrary commands on the infected machine.
Created as a personal learning exercise, and as such I take no responsibility for the damage you may do with it. You have been warned - use at your own risk.
